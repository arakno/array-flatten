# Array Flatten
Write some code, that will flatten an array of arbitrarily nested arrays of integers into a flat array of integers. e.g. [[1,2,[3]],4] -> [1,2,3,4]. 

Your solution should be a link to a gist on gist.github.com with your implementation.

When writing this code, you can use any language you're comfortable with. The code must be well tested and documented. Please include unit tests and any documentation you feel is necessary. In general, treat the quality of the code as if it was ready to ship to production.

Try to avoid using language defined methods like Ruby's Array#flatten.

Install all packages:
```
$ npm install
```

Run webpack
```
$ npm run build
```

Run tests
```
$ npm test
```

Done! Open index.html in browser for a cat image.
